## Database Schema
<img width="985" alt="Screen Shot 2019-09-18 at 9 45 13 AM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/34421236/65163896-11c94d00-d9f9-11e9-8058-8edba6b88170.png">

## Challenges
When I originally started this project, I did not setup my DB correctly, and had to go back and change/add/remove tables.

## Successes
Being able to fix the database with migrations, and not just deleting the whole thing and making another. 

## Extensions
Search all olympians by age, weight, height etc.

## Known Issues
Olympian Statistics test does not work, It has something to do with postgres I believe.
